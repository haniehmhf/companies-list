# Companies App

This is a simple app that allows you to fetch companies from an API and search for them.
To see the live demo, you can visit [Companies App]().

# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Run it locally

1. Clone the repository
   `git clone https://github.com/haniehmhf/companies-list.git`

2. Install dependencies
   `npm install`

3. Start the development server
   `npm start`

## Testing

I only added a generic test to the `App.tsx` component. I'm aware that is not a good test coverage for the project but I just wanted to show my approach instead of spending time on writing tests for all components.

Run the following command to run the tests.

`npm test`

## Possible Improvements

- Adding loaders
- Handling errors
- Use a better state management library like `Redux` or `MobX`
- Use more reliable API for fetching and adding companies
- Adding more tests
- Improve UI
- Add more filters
- Add pagination
- Add sorting
